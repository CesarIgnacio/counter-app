[video for the following notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0)

- React is a JavaScript library develloped at Facebook.
- Angular is another library (competing with React).
- React applications are made by **_Componets_**, a piece of the User Interface. One develops a variety of independat, isolated and reusable components that mixed together make a complex user interface.
- Every React application has at least **one** component, refered as the _root_ component. This _root_ represent the internal application and contains other child components.
- A React application is a _tree of components_.
- A **component** is implemented as a JavaScript class, that has some **_state_** and a **_render method_**.

[**DOM**](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-dom/)

- It means _Documented Object Model_.
- It is how a web browser represents a web page internally.
- DOM determines what content should be on a page and how each element of the conten.
- DOM is structured as a _tree_, every object is hierarchically under other object.
- Each DOM object "owns" its children. If you remove an object all its children will be also removed. Every object can have multiple children, but only one parent.
